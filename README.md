# Sregex

Simplified regular expressions (Sregex) based on the Thompson's Construction algorithm.

Supports the following operators:
 lowercase English letters (a, b, c, ...)
 |: for alternative expressions
 *: for matching matches zero of more matches of the preceding expression
 (): for grouping expressions

While this implementation supports (...*), it does not support (...)*. The latter 
is a work in progress.
