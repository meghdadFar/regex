# Sregex

Simplified regular expressions (Sregex) based on the Thompson's Construction algorithm.

Supports the following operators: <br />
lowercase English letters (a, b, c, ...) <br />
| for alternative expressions <br />
\* for matching zero or more <br />
() for grouping expressions <br />

This implementation supports (...\*), however, it does not support (...)\*. The latter 
is a work in progress.
