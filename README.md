# Sregex

Simplified regular expressions (Sregex) based on the Thompson's Construction algorithm.

Supports the following operators:
lowercase English letters (a, b, c, ...)
| for alternative expressions
\* for matching zero or more
() for grouping expressions

This implementation supports (...\*), however, it does not support (...)\*. The latter 
is a work in progress.
